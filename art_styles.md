## General style guide

### Fantasy setting

The art style of this bot will produce images that suit a high fantasy world,
such as those desscibed in the Dungeons & Dragons game. The setting is grounded
in realism, but it does contain magical and fantastical elements.

### Fantasy art style

The artwork produced should be in a fantasy art style, capturing the essence and
energy of the setting, but without exaggerated elements. Characters depicted are
heroic, but this is shown in their dynamic poses and expressions.

* Realism with a Fantastical Flair: The artwork often strikes a balance between
realism and fantasy. Characters, creatures, and landscapes are rendered with a
level of detail that gives them a sense of weight and presence, yet they also
possess an otherworldly charm that speaks to the magical nature of the D&D
universe.

* Dynamic and Expressive: Illustrations in the rule books are dynamic, capturing
the action and drama of adventure. Characters are often depicted in mid-action
poses, suggesting movement and energy, which helps to convey the excitement of
gameplay.

* Diversity in Representation: The artwork showcases a wide variety of characters,
creatures, and settings. This diversity includes different races and classes,
ensuring that the fantastical elements of the D&D world are richly represented.

* Rich Color Palettes: The use of color is both vibrant and varied, with a
tendency towards richness and depth. This aids in differentiating the many
environments and creatures found in the game, from the dark depths of dungeons
to the bright skies of fantastical landscapes.

* Mood Setting: Each piece of art is designed not just to depict a scene or
character but also to set the mood. Whether itâ€™s the eerie ambiance of a
haunted forest or the bustling energy of a city market, the art in D&D 5e
helps to create an immersive experience for the players.

* Detail-Oriented: The illustrations often contain a high level of detail,
allowing viewers to notice new aspects upon each viewing. This detail aids in
world-building, as each image can convey a wealth of information about the
culture, environment, and inhabitants of the D&D universe.

## Color palette

The bot uses both vibrant and muted colors, with a focus on light and depth.
This adds variety in the environment and character representation.
