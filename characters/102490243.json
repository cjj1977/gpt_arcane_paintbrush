In the worlds of D&amp;D, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They gather in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using illusions and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited woodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as their most important allies. These gnomes also befriend small forest animals and rely on them for information about threats that might prowl their lands.</p>",

        "backstory": "Born in a secluded forest gnome community nestled within the deep jungles of Chult, Skip was always a bit different from his kin. While others were content with the simple pleasures of gnome life, Skip was captivated by the ruins and relics scattered throughout the surrounding jungle. He spent his days exploring and his nights listening to the elders' tales of an ancient, lost city once vibrant with magic.\n\nFrom these stories, Skip developed a deep respect for history, especially for those who could remember it as their lived experience. His friendship with the elves and other fey was born from this respect, as he came to value their long memories and timeless perspectives.\n\nWhen Skip was old enough, he joined the Mystical Company of Arcane Archaeologists, drawn by their mission to discover and preserve historical knowledge. He excelled in his studies of divination magic, proving himself an invaluable asset in the Company's explorations. His expertise, combined with his brave (some would say reckless) willingness to face danger, quickly earned him a reputation.\n\nThough the jungles of Chult are far removed from the grand libraries and lecture halls of the Sword Coast, Skip wouldn't have it any other way. He thrives in the ancient tombs and ruins that most only read about, and his happiest moments are those of discovery, when he can unearth a relic or decipher an ancient text and, for a moment, touch the past.\n\nIn spite of the dangers and challenges he faces, Skip holds firm to his belief in the importance of his work. While he views other archaeological societies with disdain, seeing them as little better than looters, he sees himself as a guardian of history. He is on a quest to uncover the secrets of the lost city, not for personal gain, but to expand the world's knowledge and pay respect to those who came before.\n\nDriven by his love of history, his faith in Deneir, and his desire to contribute to the realm of knowledge, Skip ventures deeper into the jungle, always seeking, always learning, and always ready to face whatever traps - or idiots - might stand in his way.\n",
